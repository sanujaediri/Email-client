        Personal: <name>,<nick-name>,<email>,<recipient's birthday in yyyy/mm/dd>

For each recipient having a birthday, a birthday greeting is sent on the correct day. Official friends and personal recipients should be sent different messages 
Ex: "Wish you a Happy Birthday. <your name>" for an office friend,
 and "hugs and love on your birthday. <your name>" for personal recipients
